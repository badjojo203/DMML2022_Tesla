<h1>Detecting the Difficulty Level of French Texts</h1>
<p>The project consists in predicting the difficulty level of a text in French (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2). For this purpose, we have a training dataset including the columns "sentences" and "difficulty", as well as a dataset including only the column "sentences" for which we have to predict the difficulty using different approaches.</p>
<h2>Data sets</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Training data set: includes "sentences" and "difficulty" columns</li>
  <li>Unlabelled data set: includes only the "sentences" column for which we have to predict the difficulty</li>
</ul>
<h2>Approaches tested</h2>

<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>Our results by accuracy</h3>

<img src="documents/OurResults.png">
<p>We can see in the image below, after finding the best parameters and the best combination of cleaner/vectorizer/classifier, that
 the combination TfidfVectorizer/MultinomialNB/empty gives the best accuracy : 0.6667</p>

<p>We can see in the image below, the confusion matrix of our best result</p>
<p><br></p>

<img src="documents/results.png">
<p>We can see in the image below, that our technique gave the best result. The combination that gave us this result was also done without data cleaning, so we can
say that the MultinomialNB is a good technique in comparison with the other ones.</p>
